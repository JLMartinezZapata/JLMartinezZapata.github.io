     Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.<br>

   <p>
      The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past,
      good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties about the future, ambitions
      for the future, clinging to present things, and delusions about our own
      importance.<br>

       Freedom is to do what is right and not what ever you want.<br>
